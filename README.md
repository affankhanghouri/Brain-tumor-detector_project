#  Brain Tumor Classification using pytorch and preTrained model VGG16

This project presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built to classify brain tumors from MRI images into three types: **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, and **Pituitary**. The model shows outstanding performance with **99% training accuracy** and **97% test accuracy**. The **F1 scores** for all classes touch **99%**, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness.

##  Highlights

-  Built a custom CNN model from scratch (optionally supports pretrained models like EfficientNetV2)
-  Applied data transformations and augmentations (random flips, rotations, normalization)
-  Achieved high accuracy and excellent F1 scores
-  Visualized performance with metrics, loss/accuracy graphs, and confusion matrix
-  Wrote prediction function for real-world inference on unseen images
